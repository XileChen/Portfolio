### Project 3: [Accounting System for Individual Daily Use]
#### Description

The Accounting System is a software project designed to help users manage personal and shared finances effectively. It allows users to record financial transactions, generate informal financial reports, and organize shared accounts with multiple users. Key features include real-time updates, financial planning, cross-platform compatibility, and voice accessibility.

The system is built to meet various user needs:
- **Personal Accounts**: Users can create multiple financial accounts to record income and expenses.
- **Shared Accounts**: Enables collaborative financial management for groups.
- **Financial Reports**: Users can generate periodic reports with charts and audio accessibility, providing insights into income and expenditure.
- **Budget Planning**: The system offers tools for users to plan and adjust budgets based on historical data.

This project was developed as a comprehensive solution for financial management, adhering to software design principles like SOLID and incorporating accessibility for diverse users.

#### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Frameworks and APIs**:
  - Google Text-to-Speech API (for financial report audio generation)
  - Google Drive API (for remote storage of financial data)
- **Design Patterns**:
  - Iterator Pattern (for modular data access)
  - Mediator Pattern (for handling login and shared account updates)
- **Database**:
  - In-Memory and Persistent DAOs for data storage
- **Testing**:
  - High test coverage for use cases, entities, and data access layers
- **Tools**:
  - GitHub for version control
  - JUnit for testing

### Project 4: [Dr. Mario]
#### Description

This project implements a simplified version of the classic Dr. Mario game using assembly language. It features a playable game environment with capsule manipulation, virus elimination, and collision detection. The game includes features such as gravity, user control via keyboard inputs, and a win condition. The objective is to eliminate all viruses in the game to achieve victory. The project highlights milestone achievements, including dynamic game mechanics, graphical rendering, and memory management.

Key gameplay features include:
- Capsule movement and rotation.
- Collision detection and handling.
- Virus elimination with row or column matching.
- Gravity simulation for capsules and dynamic updates to the game state.
- Winning condition upon virus elimination.

This project was built to demonstrate advanced understanding of assembly programming, memory management, and game logic implementation.

#### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Assembly (MIPS)
- **Tools**: MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Collision detection.
  - Gravity simulation.
  - Win condition and elimination checks.
- **Memory Management**: Allocated memory for graphical elements and game state updates.

### Project 5: [Analysis of Airbnb Price Determinants Using Linear Regression Model]
#### Description
This project analyzed the key factors influencing Airbnb pricing using a linear regression model. The study investigated variables such as property type, room type, location (zipcode), and accommodation features to understand their quantitative impact on room rates. The research aimed to provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts to optimize pricing strategies and for guests to make informed choices. The final model incorporated both numerical and categorical variables, achieving a comprehensive understanding of price determinants in Airbnb listings.
#### Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: R
- **Statistical Methods**: Linear Regression, Residual Analysis, ANOVA
- **Visualization Tools**: Scatter Plots, Boxplots, QQ Plots
- **Data Sources**: Open-source Airbnb dataset from Georgia (data.world)

### Project 6: [Early Detection Of Alzheimer’s Disease: From Logistic Regression To XGBoost]
#### Description

This project focused on the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease by developing and evaluating machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and XGBoost. The primary aim was to achieve high precision and accuracy in classifying individuals at risk, facilitating timely interventions and improved disease management. The project highlighted the simplicity of Logistic Regression versus the superior performance of XGBoost, which achieved 96.5% accuracy with robust handling of complex feature interactions and reduced false positives/negatives. The results were validated on a Kaggle leaderboard, demonstrating the model's reliability and effectiveness.
