### Project 3: [Analysis of Airbnb Price Determinants Using Linear Regression Model]
#### Description
This project analyzed the key factors influencing Airbnb pricing using a linear regression model. The study investigated variables such as property type, room type, location (zipcode), and accommodation features to understand their quantitative impact on room rates. The research aimed to provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts to optimize pricing strategies and for guests to make informed choices. The final model incorporated both numerical and categorical variables, achieving a comprehensive understanding of price determinants in Airbnb listings.
#### Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: R
- **Statistical Methods**: Linear Regression, Residual Analysis, ANOVA
- **Visualization Tools**: Scatter Plots, Boxplots, QQ Plots
- **Data Sources**: Open-source Airbnb dataset from Georgia (data.world)

### Project 4: [Early Detection Of Alzheimer’s Disease: From Logistic Regression To XGBoost]
#### Description

This project focused on the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease by developing and evaluating machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and XGBoost. The primary aim was to achieve high precision and accuracy in classifying individuals at risk, facilitating timely interventions and improved disease management. The project highlighted the simplicity of Logistic Regression versus the superior performance of XGBoost, which achieved 96.5% accuracy with robust handling of complex feature interactions and reduced false positives/negatives. The results were validated on a Kaggle leaderboard, demonstrating the model's reliability and effectiveness.

#### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Processing Tools:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Evaluation and Deployment Tools:** Kaggle leaderboard
